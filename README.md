# SwiftUI Weather App

A weather app built with **SwiftUI** that displays current weather, hourly forecast, and daily forecast. The UI is inspired by the **Apple Weather app** and is designed using custom views for different weather components. The app demonstrates the power of **SwiftUI** to create visually rich and interactive weather interfaces.

## Features
